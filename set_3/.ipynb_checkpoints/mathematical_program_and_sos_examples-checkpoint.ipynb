    "One area of tools offered in pydrake is the MathematicalProgram interface.  MathematicalProgram is a class that abstracts many different useful types of optimization solvers.  This makes it so from one interface, you can access many different solvers.  The MathematicalProgram component of Drake is comparable to JuMP, in the Julia ecosystem. To get a concise overview of which solvers are supported for which different types of optimization problems, check out [this chart](http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case with hot-off-the-presses code, there is not yet a plethora of documentation, but here we're going to try to provide you with enough sample code to help get you started. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the code snippets below, these two tips are also very useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you construct a MathematicalProgram object, i.e. `mp = MathematicalProgram()`, the tab completion in your jupyter notebook can be very helpful.  \n",
    "\n",
    " --> For example, let's say you want to know if a MathematicalProgram can print how many decision variables currently exist.  Tab completing on `mp.` and scrolling through, you'll find `num_vars`.  Indeed `mp.num_vars()` will do the trick.\n",
    " \n",
    " --> Want to know which solver MP is currently using under the hood for a particular problem instance?\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = Solve(mp)\n",
    "print result.is_success()\n",
    "print result.GetSolution(x)\n",
    "print result.get_solver_id().name()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- An additional resource for how to use MathematicalProgram is the tests written for it. There are a significant amount of tests for MathematicalProgram, written in C++.  See [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/solvers/test/mathematical_program_test.cc) but also other tests in that folder.  Note however that not all C++ features have pydrake bindings -- for those familiar with pybind, the bindings for MathematicalProgram are generated [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/bindings/pydrake/solvers/mathematicalprogram_py.cc), and are demonstrated in numerous tests [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/bindings/pydrake/solvers/test). Obviously though the features  demonstrated below all have pydrake bindings.  There are sufficient features currently in pydrake to satisfiably complete the problem set."
